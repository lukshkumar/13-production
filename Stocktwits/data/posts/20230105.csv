2022 has been brutal to stocks in the small cap category. But one little known company has been a great investment. It is CVRX and to show how little known it is, it has only 350 followers on stock twits. Six months ago it was $5 per share. Today it is over $17. Last year it received FDA approval for its Barostim treatment for heart failure victims. It is a game changer for heart patients and is being rapidly adopted by hospitals and doctors. It also has over $5 per share in CASH and was named #2 in the Top Ten heart disease startups: medicalstartups.org/top/heart/                                            
With a current Market Cap of only$350M, once the Market discovers this little gem it could easily become a 5 to 10 bagger.

FTC lawyer James Weingarten said the agency has no plans &quot;at this time&quot; to file in federal court. The FTC has authorized staff to engage in settlement talks but &quot;there are no substantive discussions at this time.&quot; 
 
Beth Wilkinson (MSFT attorney) told Chappell (the administrative judge) that if a resolution isn&#39;t reached with the FTC, the deal will go forward and close after a remedy is reached in all pending jurisdictions. But that the companies assume the FTC would go to federal court in that case. 
 
The deal is undergoing review over in Europe and the UK and we are hoping that they will be resolved and if there are remedies that are appropriate we can come back to ‚Ä¶ the FTC to talk about a resolution.

You doing okay? I saw RLMD. G...what a **** show. I&#39;m sorry man. I know the feeling. 

I was decimated in STTK, Kod, and especially that ultra turd...TLIS. 

The ONLY suitable biotechs?

$BIO 
$TECH 

All the rest are complete garbage. But I do actually really like $BIO and $TECH over the long term. Both have been monsters.

Tech is up 73,710% (!!) since 1989 IPO. Talk about creating shareholder value. üò≤
Still only $12 billion MC

Bio up 15,557% since 1980 IPO. Also $12 billion MC. 

Those two have proven to deliver. 

But all these small biotechs? All of them are ponzi schemes to transfer wealth from retail to bio execs, hedge funds/VC/PE, and other institutional investors. 

I hope every single biotech goes BK after the garbage they pulled on retail over the past 3 years. 

More retail have likely lost life savings on these than any other sector in the history of the market.

"$BA folks, check out the rally that took place on 1/29/21 to 3/12/22 that  went from $194 to $277? what caused that I still don&#39;t know. But what I do know is that the fundamentals are different now. Increased production numbers, improving FCF, enormous backlog, and all the technical problems behind Boeing , has  triggered a trend reversal.  It&#39;s been roughly 2 years for me, but I&#39;m glad I did not sell during that rally last year. yes I did have my finger on a trigger to sell,  but this time I&#39;m waiting for a 350 to 400 to sell my original position.

Idle speculation. Mgt will meet w FDA shortly armed with control of the 2 most important ingredients for the triple combo. The missing piece isn&#39;t all that good anyway and there are better, safer alternatives like Opdivo and Keytruda to replace BA. 
 
HPV16+ refractory cancers currently have a median life expectancy of 3-4 months, the very definition of hi unmet need. Here PDS has a treatment with data from the NCI that shows they can extend that to 21 months using a CPI that is inferior to others approved &amp; available. 
 
If you are the FDA, would you make them go back to a brand new P2 or would you help them design a pivotal P2/3 trial to get this to market ASAP to save lives? Adcentris was approved based on pivotal P2 trial w only 100 participants after stellar P1 results. PDS could get the same.

I have made some comparisons between PAA and NGL in the past.  It would seem that NGL&#39;s debt level has constrained its recovery out of the 2020 crash but the progress being announced is a real step forward for NGL.   
 
I do think that until the common gets the dividend reinstated that a $7 target may be a little to the high side but I&#39;m willing to rotate from some energy dividend stocks now for the recovery gains that appear to be on the 2023 horizon for NGL.
