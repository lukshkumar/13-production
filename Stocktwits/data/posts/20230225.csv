"$NVDA - Gearing up for one more leg up 
 
My NVDA roadmap considers that we&#39;re in green wave IV, and getting ready for another leg up for wave V. 
 
This could take us all the way to 260+ before another correction. 
 
230 is strong resistance, and this sideways consolidation is necessary for it to be broken.

NYSE: “Independent director” is one who the board “affirmatively determines” has no “materiality relationship” with the company “either directly or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company.” 
 
Some researchers have complained that firms have appointed “independent directors who are overly sympathetic to management, while still technically independent according to regulatory definitions.”

"Quick Recap: 
 
- $SPY - Well if you didn&#39;t notice, market was in a fun spiral today. Our team took advantage with some huge gains! 
 
- $AMD and $XLNX are looking too sweet to ignore down here. Looks like we are one step closer to the merger! 
 
- $MSFT if tech can hold a bit, this is a HUGE discount down here. Will be looking to make sure she holds here into a holiday weekend and taking advantage! 
 
- $IWM Give me $211/212 for another rinse and repeat run to $220s.. sooner or later she will run and not come back. 
 
So many other discounts out there right now! It is all about timing!!!!

"$NVDA who is waking up this morning and thinking “I need to buy me some NVDA at $224, $225, or maybe even $226?” A dump back to sub $220 is coming sooner than later. Trading at an unsustainable multiple, heading into a potential jumbo rate hike in March, and a recession in the coming months on top of the fact that there is an AI bubble? Plus, all financials are down from a year ago, but they promise to do better in this environment? Give this a fair multiple of other mega cap tech and it’s trading around $65, at best. It’ll pump, sure, but if you owned this before the ER and don’t take profits, you hate your money. If you’re buying this morning at $225, you hate your money. And if you’re buying at $225, you might be that person that loses more than they win in the market - much more downside than upside at this level.

US companies tipped for strong earnings season despite growing threats 
 
Growth expected for nine of 11 sectors on the S&amp;P 500, even as inflation bites 
 
Big US companies are expected to demonstrate their health by reporting strong profits for the past quarter even as high inflation, wage pressure, supply chain disruption and the Omicron coronavirus variant cloud the outlook. 
 
As earnings season kicks off this week, companies in the S&amp;P 500 stock index are forecast to deliver year-on-year earnings growth of nearly 22 per cent for the final three months of 2021, following an increase of almost 40 per cent in the previous quarter, according to Wall Street estimates collated by data provider FactSet. 
 
Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, said he expects a “colossal” set of results across the board, driven by “strong top-line sales”.",2022-01-14,00:05:22,SPY,478284.0,102,1627,1539027,81207,2018-07-05,60243,205,,,,,None,,426612537

U.S. Spending Momentum Index (SMI) for December stands at 108.4 in December as indicated by data from Visa; it is the strongest reading for the month since the start of the index. 
 
SMI for the last three months of the year stood at 110.3 which is the highest for Q4 of a year. 
Note: When the Visa SMI rises above 100, the consumer spending momentum is strengthening and when it falls below 100, the spending momentum is weakening as fewer consumers are spending more relative to the previous year. 
 
Category-wise: SMI for discretionary purchases narrowed 4.9 points from the previous month to 103 while for non-discretionary purchases it moved marginally (0.1 points) to 99.9. 
Region-wise: Midwest and South saw the most drop with 4 points each while Northeast reading fell 2.5 points and the West slid 1.8 points; West was the strongest performing region in December with an SMI reading of 110.1.

Nine of the 11 sectors represented in the S&amp;P 500 are forecast to report earnings growth for the fourth quarter, with energy, industrials, and materials likely to lead the way, said John Butters, senior analyst at FactSet. The only sectors where profits are forecast to shrink are utilities and financials. 
 
The earnings season comes at a fraught moment for Wall Street equities, which have started 2022 with volatile trading as investors scrutinise the Federal Reserve’s more aggressive stance on fighting inflation. 
Binky Chadha, chief strategist at Deutsche Bank, noted that given the “extraordinary collapse and then surge in earnings” as a result of the pandemic, looking at the change in fourth-quarter profits compared with the previous quarter would be more significant than annual figures. Earnings are forecast to have fallen about 4.6 per cent on that basis, when also accounting for seasonal factors, Chadha said.",2022-01-14,00:09:41,SPY,478284,102,1627,1539027,81207,2018-07-05,60243,205,,,,,None,,426613736

It is worth noting that the company has already attracted investment from high-profile individuals such as Jerry Jones and John Goff, who have combined to invest into GMSQF, making them the company’s largest investors. Additionally, the company has moved its headquarters and operations to the Star in Frisco (Cowboys Facility), further emphasizing its commitment to growth and success. 

The company is led by Tom Rodgers, the former President of NBC Universal Cable and Executive Vice President of NBC, who brings a wealth of experience to the table. Furthermore, the company’s partnership with Glytch, which is building 32 Esports stadiums, is a clear indication of its commitment to the gaming industry.

Finally, the company’s advertising network, with an audience of 350 million monthly followers, is poised to become the largest in the industry, further enhancing its potential for growth and profitability.",2023-02-23,11:58:41,NVDA,417343.0,13,73,265521,1818,2013-09-27,219,30,,,,,None,1,513813018

 I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to introduce you to a highly promising investment opportunity in Engine Gaming and Media. With a Total Addressable Market (TAM) of 200 billion, the company is poised for significant growth in the coming years.

The company has already demonstrated strong revenue growth with its Game Engine and GAME Square businesses contributing to a combined revenue of 100 million in 2023 with a guidance of 40% YoY growth rate. This is further supported by a comparable company analysis that values the company at two and a half times its 2023 sales of 100 million which gives it a conservative market cap of $250 million. So we take the market cap of $250 million, divided by $42million shares outstanding, equaling $5.95 per share. 

In addition, the company is on track to be profitable in the second half of 2023 and will be listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol GAME following the combination of Game Engine and GAME Square.",2023-02-23,11:56:41,NVDA,417212.0,13,73,265521,1818,2013-09-27,219,30,,,,,None,,513812782

A strong recovery in corporate America’s profits from pandemic-driven lows has helped keep common measures of valuation in check even while stock prices have surged. The S&amp;P 500 is priced at 21 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, compared with 23 times a year ago, despite the index having gained 23 per cent over that period. 
However, US stocks are still priced well above the average of about 16 times forward earnings over the past two decades, FactSet data show. Analysts say disappointing corporate results could make stocks look even more expensive, dimming their allure to investors. 
 
Investors will get an early glimpse of earnings trends when Delta Air Lines reports results on Thursday, followed on Friday by the banks JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo and the asset management behemoth BlackRock.

A bivalent Pfizer or Moderna booster increased protection initially by 52 percent, but that protection dropped to 36 percent beyond 59 days, U.S. CDC said. The researchers separately looked at people who had received two or more monovalent doses and no bivalent booster. They found ages 18 to 64 had just 19 percent protection against COVID and aged 65+ had just 28 percent protection.

Yahoo (in Statistics section of NCGMY) says their total debt is 2.26B and total cash is 764M. Their forward yield is 3.46%.  So Newmont would have to assume roughly 1.5B in Newcrest debt plus a new bid greater than 17B which dilutes Newmont shareholders (what, like 40%-50%) and probably puts the new dividend in the low 3&#39;s (worse if POG &lt; 1600) for how long?

Don&#39;t forget, the small animal studies done showed the immune system completely shut down resulting in death. This is the NEW AND IMPROVED BOOSTER. From the CDC: 
A bivalent Pfizer or Moderna booster increased protection initially by 52 percent, but that protection dropped to 36 percent beyond 59 days, U.S. CDC said. The researchers separately looked at people who had received two or more monovalent doses and no bivalent booster. They found ages 18 to 64 had just 19 percent protection against COVID and aged 65+ had just 28 percent protection.

"Office landlord Columbia Property Trust, which is controlled by Pimco, has defaulted on about $1.7 billion of mortgage notes on seven buildings in San Francisco, New York, Boston and Jersey City, New Jersey. This follows a default by Brookfield on loans tied to two Los Angeles office towers earlier this month. US offices, particularly older buildings with fewer amenities, have struggled in recent years with the rise of remote work during the pandemic and recent layoffs. Values of those properties have fallen 20% since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, according to Green Street.   $DPZ  $DWAC $BABA $NVDA $AAPL !",2023-02-23,13:03:04,NVDA,417370.0,71,1085,1337652,68473,2017-12-28,54046,101,,,,,Bearish,,513823517

"$OXY Looks like $BRK.A $BRK.B ER was decent enough. No surprises.  Operating profits decent considering inflation costs to insurance business, but significant loss on investment/trading side of the house. Cash hoard has grown significantly and he’s setup for two things:
1.  Enough cash to avoid hitting the expensive debt market if the economy suffers/insurance claims increase due to a disaster.  
2.  More than enough to continue buying other companies as their valuations come back down to earth.
Major thing is he’s not planning to step down so support for OXY is still there.  If he was restricted, he can buy starting Thursday, but hopefully we’re well above $62, so that he has no immediate reason to do so.  
OXY buying back shares at 5% rate ($3.48ish per year), so his “valuation” of OXY will climb accordingly over time.  Buyback rate may increase if preferred will be redeemed.  55 hours until OXY ER and guidance…

Well, here&#39;s how, they AGGRESSIVELY DO THINGS, FEBRUARY WILL NOW BE END OF TREASURY BUYS IN MARKETS &amp; 1st hike will be March , and, yes, bulls, listen up, aggressive means a DOUBLE HIKE. 

Now, this can give JOLTS! But, .50% is my guess for March, and, to be aggressive , they&#39;ll need to do FIVE TO SIX MORE HIK3LES IN 2023.

That&#39;s the tweet.

"$OXY Looks like $BRK.A $BRK.B ER was decent enough. No surprises.  Operating profits decent considering inflation costs to insurance business, but significant loss on investment/trading side of the house. Cash hoard has grown significantly and he’s setup for two things:

2.  More than enough to continue buying other companies as their valuations come back down to earth.
Major thing is he’s not planning to step down so support for OXY is still there.  If he was restricted, he can buy starting Thursday, but hopefully we’re well above $62, so that he has no immediate reason to do so.

HERE is a conundrum too, the FED said you remember back 2012, &quot;FED will aim for more transparency,&quot; well, THAT is about to change.

At the 26th meeting, they will announce they are going to taper back to 25 to 0 bond buying, that will be the target, much like when FED says they are raising rates 0.25%, they have that range to Jack the rate, 0 to .0.25%.

So yeah, February will be A MOST INTERESTING MONTH IN THE MARKETS AS 80 BILLOON BONDS WILL GET CUT DOWN TO 20 BILLION, they may be vague (untransparent) and say 40 BILLION.
But trust me, with the inflation CRISIS we truly got going on ALREADY, the gun case is bare, no more bullets left, so they really can&#39;t even do the 20 BILLION LIQUIDITY in February w/ likely stoking the market to even wilder inflation!!

"Can you believe these Fed idiots saying that there maybe a case for 5 hikes this year?  For most of last year, when inflation was running hot with food/gas prices on the surge, the super duper pumper &quot;Powell&quot; kept insisting that inflation is transitory and the markets were rejoicing it.  Now, it&#39;s NOT transitory anymore and they are building a case for 5 hikes... lol

I mean, this is out of control with what Powell is doing to these markets... He let the bubble become bigger and bigger by not controlling last year and now he wants to burst it with several hikes and will lead to a recession for sure now.  smh

"$GOLD $AU $SBSW $GLD $NEM 

What’s your stance. 
My view is gold retests ATH’s in H2 2023
and makes a move to $2,200
That’s my call. 
Long term we see $3,000+ in the next few years. 
Facts are, world central banks are accumulating gold at record levels. 
Why would they do that if gold was going to $1,200-$1,500?
All currencies will continue to be revalued due to excessive printing. 
All countries will keep printing. That’s all they can do. Paper fiat is worthless. 
Physical assets are the only thing with value. 
Prepare for the next super cycle in commodities. 👍🍿

There are signs that consumers are starting to falter. Shoppers have cut back on spending on consumer electronics, furniture and clothing.

The AABB Golden Baboon Mining Club will be featuring Ahbibi and a cast of characters in the Otherside Metaverse?

"$QQQ $SPY $SPX here&#39;s why I have been buying the $TLT in small bundles, at these low/sub 100s. 

Simplified analysis: watch all the long term inverse supports between the 90s and low 100s - might have to give some &#39;swing-allowance&#39;, before the uprising. 

P.S - It&#39;s hard to time the rally. But that huge red 2022, don&#39;t suggest another red year. At least, not yet.

Just curious how relevant are foreign investors to these established companies that just print money? I understand a company that is raising capital will need foreign investors but a large dividend paying company such as PBR does not need the foreign investors. The market cap and SP is irrelevant to future of these companies. 
Indeed when dividends are large it is foreign investors like us that need PBR. If share price goes down I will buy more because that automatically translates into high dividend yield. I prefer to buy Vale at $8 and get 10

"$AMD As previously touched on here $NVDA earnings highlight that $AMD has been taking market share from $NVDA in the gaming sector. 
 
This just puts the icing on the cake that argues why $AMD is such a good value at these levels.  
 
In the Enterprise/Server/Cloud market both $XLNX embedded solutions and AMD Pensando DPU offerings give $AMD unrivaled leadership once you factor in the performance and cost savings of their new EPYC chips. 
 
In the consumer space, AMD&#39;s CPU offerings continue to outsell $INTC. The problem as I have commented on many times is that they dropped the ball on their AM5 rollout because it was not backward compatible and they made no attempt to address issues associated with the increased total costs including some justifiable worries about cooling issues.

"$CVNA The biggest gains are always made by buying a position when everybody else is betting against it.  I remember Luckin Coffee in 2020.  I bought shares when it was delisted due to accounting fraud on the premise that at the end of the day, there were still a lot of people buying the coffee.  Shares were trading at $1 when I bought, they are now over $30 (3 years later).  Similar returns to buying $AMZN in 2008 and holding until today.  This week, I did the same with $CVNA.  There are people buying cars, $13B worth per year.  But it&#39;s unprofitable!?!?!  So was AMZN, TSLA, and every other tech giant that&#39;s worth north of $100B today.

&quot;Relative valuation and inventory management appears to favor Micron. Nanya Technology&#39;s inventory days blow-out increases risk of write-downs impacting its next earnings.&quot; - Vincent Fernando, CFA

Key Points:
* Long Micron vs. Short Nanya - We remain biased to Long Micron vs. Nanya Technology based on multiple factors.

"@Goldust69 @ApeTownBanger there was a time I was the same but it just depleted my 💴. Have to see all the angles. On a side note I can say that I believe  bc of all the recent hype next week or 2 may see downswing and then when people least expect it they are gonna kill all the put options. Will probably let this run at that time only to pull the rug on all the fomo buyers. And the end result will be is that they won and a small portion of profit takers will benefit. Then they will rinse and repeat until the market crashes big, maybe sometime in q3 or q4. This doesn’t just pertain to this play imo. But in all the meme, crypto, and overall market.

Probably the dumbest analysis, trying to smack-talk the world&#39;s most favorite precious metal, lol.

Paying attention to the 10 year &#39;Cup Breakout&#39; now, and the subsequent &#39;Handle&#39; fulfilment. Might take 1-2 years of sideways between 1600s and 1900s, prior tho - given the nature of Gold consolidation periods.

Listen old man , you should not be chasing a lotto ticket with Penny stocks . You know the odds of hitting is extremely small. You should have learned this by now .This is equivalent to walking into a casino and play roulette, the casino game with the lowest odds of winning . 
Also , you couldn’t even comprehend my post . My point was a lot of  QUALITY stocks are down …. They present opportunity. And you said CLOV is down too. Listen bro, CLOV IS NOT A QUALITY STOCK . It’s no $HD , $ MSFT,  $FB, etc etc etc .

"$PARA Paramount had a quick mention in Warren Buffett&#39;s annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors: https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2022ltr.pdf  
 
&quot;Berkshire now enjoys major ownership in an unmatched collection of huge and diversified businesses. Let’s first look at the 5,000 or so publicly-held companies that trade daily on NASDAQ, the NYSE and related venues. Within this group is housed the members of the S&amp;P 500 Index, an elite collection of large and well-known American companies. 
 
In aggregate, the 500 earned $1.8 trillion in 2021. I don’t yet have the final results for 2022. Using, therefore, the 2021 figures, only 128 of the 500 (including Berkshire itself) earned $3 billion or more. Indeed, 23 lost money. 
 
At yearend 2022, Berkshire was the largest owner of eight of these giants: American Express, Bank of America, Chevron, Coca-Cola, HP Inc., Moody’s, Occidental Petroleum and Paramount Global.&quot;",2023-02-25,18:52:59,PARA,19374.0,0,2,6090728,294,2021-11-10,1180,20,Berkshirehathaway,,https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2022ltr.pdf,,Bullish,1,514276730

$BRK.B prospects for the future. The stock is poised to go up if the market Rises and it&#39;s supposed to go up if the market goes down. The reason being if the market goes down Berkshire has money to buy more shares of whatever they decide to buy. If it goes up it&#39;s already got a huge chunk of Apple which looks to be ready to go higher.

"$OXY For those new to OXY or need a refresher, read the transcript (link below) from Q1/22 ER CC.  Especially the Q&amp;A that goes into detail about the preferred buybacks, debt reduction, and targets.  They hit the $18B level in Q4 that they said would trigger them to focus more on buybacks than debt.
No large tranche of debt due until late 2024, which is still reasonable, per CFO.  So likely FCF will be hitting preferred shares later this quarter or Q2.   Remember, they didn’t really kick off buybacks until Q3, so the rolling 12 months means they don’t have much left (until Q3) before hitting the limit and forced to buy $BRK.B preferred if they buy more commons.  
Only major negative was their revised estimate of $95 Brent for 2022.  FY was spot on, but Q4 was slightly lower and even lower now.  Not to mention NG tanking.  So guidance might not be great despite FY22 results.  
Still expect plenty of FCF for the buyback plans this year.

"$OXY For those new to OXY or need a refresher, read the transcript (link below) from Q1/22 ER CC.  Especially the Q&amp;A that goes into detail about the preferred buybacks, debt reduction, and targets.  They hit the $18B level in Q4 that they said would trigger them to focus more on buybacks than debt.
No large tranche of debt due until late 2024, which is still reasonable, per CFO.  So likely FCF will be hitting preferred shares later this quarter or Q2.   Remember, they didn’t really kick off buybacks until Q3, so the rolling 12 months means they don’t have much left (until Q3) before hitting the limit and forced to buy $BRK.B preferred if they buy more commons.  
Only major negative was their revised estimate of $95 Brent for 2022.  FY was spot on, but Q4 was slightly lower and even lower now.  Not to mention NG tanking.  So guidance might not be great despite FY22 results.  
Still expect plenty of FCF for the buyback plans this year.

"$OXY For those new to OXY or need a refresher, read the transcript (link below) from Q1/22 ER CC.  Especially the Q&amp;A that goes into detail about the preferred buybacks, debt reduction, and targets.  They hit the $18B level in Q4 that they said would trigger them to focus more on buybacks than debt.
No large tranche of debt due until late 2024, which is still reasonable, per CFO.  So likely FCF will be hitting preferred shares later this quarter or Q2.   Remember, they didn’t really kick off buybacks until Q3, so the rolling 12 months means they don’t have much left (until Q3) before hitting the limit and forced to buy $BRK.B preferred if they buy more commons.  
Only major negative was their revised estimate of $95 Brent for 2022.  FY was spot on, but Q4 was slightly lower and even lower now.  Not to mention NG tanking.  So guidance might not be great despite FY22 results.

"$NVDA Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland, who has a positive rating and per-share price target of $265 on Nvidia (NVDA), noted that the results from gaming more than offset any concerns about data center, while adding that all four segments - gaming, professional visualization, automotive and embedded and data center - should see future growth.

KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh, who has an outperform rating and per-share price target of $280, noted the opportunities the company sees in generative AI, particularly around ChatGPT, which is widely believed to use Nvidia&#39;s (NVDA) GPUs to help train its large language models.

Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore, who has an equal-weight rating and per-share price target of $255 on Nvidia (NVDA), said he was concerned about the short-term weakness in the data center, but GPUs are still an area of &quot;relative strength&quot; in the cloud",2023-02-23,14:02:10,NVDA,417378.0,8,1057,2178417,25316,2019-07-04,48814,137,,,,,Bullish,,513835564

The RSI reading is the only thing that maybe says recovery, but I see more bad than good for sure (and that is compounded by how the #NASDAQ and #DowJones look)
